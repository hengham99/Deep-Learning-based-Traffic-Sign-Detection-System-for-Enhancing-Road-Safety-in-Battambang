# Deep Learning-based Traffic Sign Detection System for Enhancing Road Safety in Battambang

Traffic signs are important for keeping roads safe and helping drivers follow rules. In Battambang, Cambodia, where roads can be busy in towns and quiet in rural areas, having a good system to spot traffic signs can improve road safety. This project aims to build a deep learning-based system that can detect traffic signs in real-time to help drivers and reduce accidents.

The main goal of this project is to create a smart system that can quickly and correctly find traffic signs on the road. The system will warn drivers about important signs, assist self-driving cars in understanding the road better, and offer a low-cost solution that can work well in places like Battambang. By using deep learning, the project aims to build a system that is flexible, easy to use, and helps reduce accidents.

The project will follow key steps: data collection, model training, and system deployment. First, data will be collected from different areas in Battambang, various lighting conditions and traffic sign types found throughout Battambang. The data will be prepared by resizing images, improving image quality, and labeling signs to help the model learn better.
